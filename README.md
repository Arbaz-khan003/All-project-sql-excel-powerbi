# SAMPLE OF MY WORK ON DAILY BASIS IN LOGISTICS COMPANY
(1) I have shared details about uploading three Monthly samples, including an MIS (Management Information System) data file, which serves as the main data sample.
The "Main data sample" file contains the following sheets:

Delhivery mis
Primex mis
Sheet1
Weight mis

(2) The "MIS " file contains a  sheet named weight file,dead file.

(a) Delhivery mis: Contains detailed shipping records, including waybill numbers, clients, dates (manifest, pickup, expected delivery), package details (weight, attempts, invoice), and geographic details (state, zone). Key metrics like "Weight," "Package Amount," and delivery attempts are available.

(b) Primex mis: Tracks shipments managed by the company with fields like booking branches, GR numbers, consignor details, and financial charges (e.g., fuel surcharge, total). Key columns include "Total" and "GrandTotal."

(c) Weight mis: Focuses on shipment weight metrics, such as:

Volumetric Weight (initial and current)
Charged Weight (box level and LR level)
Status updates like "Shipment Status" and "Delivery Date."

(3) The MIS is generated by:

Extracting Key Fields: Consolidating data such as waybill numbers, weights (volumetric/current), and shipment statuses from the main dataset.
Transforming Data: Calculating derived metrics like weight differences, penal vs actual weights, and aggregating totals for branches or clients.
Structuring Output: Presenting data in a summary table for operational insights.
